> How's like to be an international student in ICLab

Hey there, tech enthusiasts and future visionaries! If you're reading this, you must be on the hunt for an adventure that takes your love for technology to a whole new level. Well, guess what? You've hit the jackpot because I'm going to introduce you to a great place, ICLab from KAIST! KAIST is one of the top science and technology universities not only in South Korea but also in the world. Still not sure why you should give it a try? Hold on tight — we're just getting started!

## 1. Research Opportunities

First off, there is a wide variety of research opportunities in our lab, ranging from smart speakers and smart home appliances to visualisation tools and privacy management tools. You can always find the area that you are interested in. Talking about publications, our lab has published our work in different international journals, including some top-tier journals like CHI. Work hard and your hard work will pay off!

## 2. Culture

Despite working, another fascinating thing about studying overseas is to experience a new culture. The language, the Confucian immersed society, the working atmosphere… Everything is so new, even for an Asian like me! Learning a new culture is enjoyable as you can broaden your horizons through conversations and cooperation with the locals. Understanding views from different cultures made me become more open-minded and gave me a new perspective on my life. (Though my friends always make fun of my mini-bow when I return to my home country for a holiday after staying in Korea for a year…)

## 3. Supportive Labmates

Not to deny, adapting to new cultures is not always an easy task. However, our lab members got my back and are always willing to help. Whether discussing research details, presenting project findings, or brainstorming new ideas, I can always count on constructive feedback from my labmates. Not just in terms of academic support, their encouragement during stressful times also reminded me that I'm not alone in this journey.

## 4. Beautiful Campus with Cute Animals

Talking about the campus environment, the campus is so beautiful, no matter in which season. But make sure you get yourself a bicycle because the campus is way too big to explore on foot. You can see geese, ducks, cats, raccoons and even water deer on the campus! Sometimes I really feel like it is a zoo instead of a campus. But trust me, you should think twice if you have arachnophobia. I have never seen this many spiders in my life, and I swear there's a gigantic spider that should be named Aragog.

## 5. Engaging Events

Throughout the year, various events will be held by the International Scholar and Student Services (ISSS) team, KAIST International Students Association (KISA), for example, international food festivals and cultural classes. You can be sure you won't be the only international student here! The school also has different festivals, and celebrities will be invited to perform at KAIST sometimes. Be sure you don't miss that out! Except for the school events, we also have lab events that bring the labmates together in a relaxed setting, such as strawberry parties in the springs, where we go on picnics on campus.

## 6. Scholarship

And finally, the most important part would be the financial support. In my case, the tuition fee was fully covered by the KAIST international scholarship and I could get a stipend every month for daily expenses. Of course, the amount of the stipend can never be compared to the salary from a full-time job, but that is enough to cover my living expenses. With these financial-aids, I didn't have any financial stress during my study at KAIST.
