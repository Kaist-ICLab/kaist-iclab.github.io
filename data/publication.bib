  abstract   = {Recent efforts to predict stress in the wild using mobile technology have increased; however, the field lacks a common pipeline for assessing the impact of factors such as label encoding and feature selection on prediction performance. This gap hinders replication, especially because of a lack of common guidelines for reporting results or privacy concerns that limit access to open codes and datasets. Our study introduces a common pipeline based on a comprehensive literature review and offers comprehensive evaluations of key pipeline factors, promoting independent reproducibility. Our systematic evaluation aimed to validate the findings of previous studies. We identified overfitting and distribution shifts across users as the major reasons for performance limitations. We used K-EmoPhone, a public dataset, for experimentation and a new public dataset---DeepStress---to validate the findings. Furthermore, our results suggest that researchers should carefully consider temporal order in cross-validation settings. Additionally, self-report labels for target users are key to enhancing performance in user-independent scenarios.},

  abstract   = {Emotional labor refers to the process in which workers are required to express emotions regardless of their actual feelings by the organization. In workplaces where such display rules exist, workers experience an emotional workload. Continued exposure to emotional workload can lead to severe mental and psychological issues. Nevertheless, research on assessing emotional workload remains understudied. In this study, we propose a machine learning model to automatically evaluate workers' emotional workload in emotional labor situations through multimodal sensing. The data collection study was designed based on a call center scenario. Within the study, we manipulated customer behaviors as confederates and assessed the worker's emotional workload. As a result, this study provides a benchmark using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. We achieved an accuracy of up to 87\% for binary and three-class classification cases. Finally, we discuss the significance of assessing emotional workload and considerations for its practical application in the workplace.},

We transformed the customer's voice by modulating its pitch and found its potential value for designing a user interface for proactive voice modulation.

In this paper we examine 18.8 million question and answer pairs from Jisiklog, the largest mobile pay-foranswer Q&A service in Korea, and the results of a complementary survey study of 245 Jisiklog workers. The data are used to investigate key motivators of participation, working strategies of experienced users, and longitudinal interaction dynamics. We find that answerers are rarely motivated by social factors but are motivated by financial incentives and intrinsic motives. Additionally, although answers are provided quickly, an answerer's topic selection tends to be broad, with experienced workers employing unique strategies to answer questions and judge relevance. Finally, analysis of longitudinal working patterns and community dynamics demonstrate the robustness of mobile pay-for-answer Q&A. These findings have significant implications on the design of mobile pay-for-answer Q&A.},

  abstract  = {Recently questioning and answering (Q&A) communities that facilitate knowledge sharing among people have been introduced to the mobile environments such as Naver Mobile Q&A and ChaCha. These mobile Q&A services are very different from traditional Q&A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&A usage. To understand mobile Q&A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&A users. We find that mobile Q&A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities - its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs. Our main findings reported in the paper have significant implications on the design of mobile Q&A systems.},

  abstract  = {Today, retailers spend considerable efforts to provide a personalized shopping experience to their customers. As data-driven marketing helps to meet customer requirements, it is important to understand individual needs. However, offline stores---unlike their online counterparts---have great difficulty knowing their customers' needs due to a lack of proper context information. In this paper, we proposed a framework for estimating customer interests by using various sensor devices. The participants in our pilot study expected that recommendation services that adopt their interests would help to reduce their shopping time. As a result, shop assistants will have a stronger ability to understand, analyze, and even predict customer interests in the near future.},

  abstract  = {Mobile peer-to-peer systems have recently got in the lime-light of the research community that is striving to build efficient and effective mobile content addressable networks. Along this line of research, we propose a network coding based file swarming protocol targeting vehicular ad hoc net-works (VANET). We argue that file swarming protocols in VANET should deal with typical mobile network issues such as dynamic topology and intermittent connectivity as well as various other issues that have been disregarded in previous mobile peer-to-peer researches such as addressing, node/user density, non-cooperativeness, and unreliable channel. Through simulation, we show that the efficiency and effectiveness of our protocol allows shorter file downloading time compared to an existing VANET file swarming protocol.},
