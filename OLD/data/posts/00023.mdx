Last Fall, IC Lab and our professor Uichin Lee lectured on an undergraduate HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) course.

The students learned the spirit and methods of HCI and got hands-on experience in design, by following the user-centric process from needfinding to iterative evaluation of prototypes. 

It must not be easy for students to do many assignments and presentations, but they achieved much while exercising the well-structured design practices. The passion of every student who finished the seven-step design projects made the course meaningful.

Here, we proudly introduce all projects done by students.

“Workaholism is a form of addiction that brings as many adverse effects as any other kinds of addiction. Many undergraduate students suffer from this problem, especially those that have to juggle between internships and studies, along with life at the same time. We believe that our application has done a great job in **helping our target users with workaholism.**”

## **Best Interaction Award - Coldhand**

이상화, 이해준, 강현희 

Coldhand introduces smartphone application design that helps users to **manage their time wisely**. The UI introduces uncomfortable interaction, which intentionally stops smartphone usage after a certain amount of time and a user has to complete a given task (e.g., solving math problems, do squats) to continue their smartphone usage.

“Overall, our prototype can offer users **extensive control over the alerts that they receive on their devices in their daily lives**. Our main goal from that start, that we believe we have achieved, was to expand upon and improve the existing systems that are currently available on native operating systems and collect them into an easy to use, intertwined and intuitive interface.”

## **GPT**

김성준, 박한성

### 

“A prevalent use case for ChatGPT is the correction of essays, with users seeking assistance in grammar and contextual refinement. Our interface addresses this challenge by **introducing visual elements to ChatGPT's results**. Modified text is highlighted with noticeable colors, providing users with a clear indication of changes. We also offer justifications for the corrections made, empowering users to understand the reasoning behind each modification. Users can selectively revert corrections, ensuring only valid changes are incorporated.”

“Our interface's first strength lies in its design. Given that the primary purpose of our application is "**Distraction Blocking**," we aimed for a simple design that minimizes visual elements that could distract users in a workspace. Our goal is to block all unnecessary distractions of a smartphone while working and to increase motivation through a sense of collective effort.”

The interface was designed with the sole purpose of helping **gym-goers make the best use of their time** spent in exercising at the gym. Anyone who has used the gym is likely to have experienced difficulties in carrying out their exercise plan fully, especially when the gym is crowded and equipment is rarely available. A user can sort the list of equipment by remaining time, name in both ascending and descending order, or filter by the body parts for which the equipment is used to train. Each equipment in the list consists of its image, name, number of users sharing the equipment, and remaining sets and time.

**FriendlyShift** a must-have daily companion for factory workers. The primary reason why factory workers want to use FriendlyShift is its highly factory-worker-optimised feature set combined with a very usable, elegant and simple design. FriendlyShift acts as an add-on to other calendar applications and allows factory workers in shift schedules to use their normal calendar application with an expanded set of personalised features.
